The Sermons of John Wesley - Sermon 50
The Use Of Money

"I say unto you, Make unto yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness; that, when ye fail, they may receive you into the everlasting habitations." Luke 16:9.
「あなたがたに言います。不正の富を用いて友を作りなさい。そうしておけば、あなたがたが落ちぶれたとき、彼らが永遠の住まいに迎えてくれます」（ルカ16:9）

1 Our Lord, having finished the beautiful parable of the Prodigal Son, which he had particularly addressed to those who murmured at his receiving publicans and sinners, adds another relation of a different kind, addressed rather to the children of God. "He said unto his disciples," not so much to the scribes and Pharisees to whom he had been speaking before, -- "There was a certain rich man, who had a steward, and he was accused to him of wasting his goods. And calling him, he said, Give an account of thy stewardship, for thou canst be no longer steward." (Luke 16:1, 2.)
（一）　私たちの主が、放蕩息子の美しいたとえを話された相手は、取税人や罪人を主が受け入れていることに不満を抱いている者たちでした。放蕩息子のたとえ話を終えられると、次に主は違った種類のたとえ話を、今度は神の子供たちに向けて話されました。「主は弟子たちに話された」。先ほどまで律法学者やパリサイ人に話していましたが、語りかける対象が変わりました。「ある金持ちの男がいた。管理人を雇っていたが、財産を浪費していたので、男は管理人を責めた。管理人を呼び出して言った。『もう管理をさせるわけにはいかないから、どういう管理をしてきたのか説明しなさい』」（ルカ一六・一〜二）。
After reciting the method which the bad steward used to provide against the day of necessity, our Saviour adds, "His lord commended the unjust steward" namely, in this respect, that he used timely precaution; and subjoins this weighty reflection, "The children of this world are wiser in their generation than the children of light:" (Luke 16:8:) Those who seek no other portion than this world "are wiser" (not absolutely; for they are one and all the veriest fools, the most egregious madmen under heaven; but, "in their generation," in their own way; they are more consistent with themselves; they are truer to their acknowledged principles; they more steadily pursue their end) "than the children of light;" -- than they who see "the light of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ."
悪い管理人が必要に備えて取った行動を主は説明してから、こう付け加えました。「主人は不正な管理人をほめた」。管理人がほめられたのは、時にかなった予防策を講じたという点でした。それから次の重要な考察を加えました。「この世の子らは自分たちの世代のことについては光の子らよりも賢い」（ルカ一六・八）。この世での相続分を何よりも求める者が「賢い」と言われています。（とはいえ、すべての点でそうなのではありません。天のことに関しては、彼らはひとり残らず極度な愚か者で狂人です。ですが、「自分たちの世代のことについて」は自分なりの流儀を持っていて、やり方が首尾一貫しています。彼らは自分で認めた原理原則には忠実です。目的を熱心に追求します。）ただ賢いというのではなく、「光の子ら」、つまり「イエス・キリストの御顔に神の栄えの光」を見る者よりも賢いと言われています。
Then follow the words above recited: "And I," -- the only-begotten Son of God, the Creator, Lord, and Possessor of heaven and earth and all that is therein; the Judge of all, to whom ye are to "give an account of your stewardship," when ye "can be no longer stewards;" "I say unto you," -- learn in this respect, even of the unjust steward, -- "make yourselves friends," by wise, timely precaution, "of the mammon of unrighteousness." "Mammon" means riches or money.
それから言葉を続けておられます。「そこで、私が」――神の独り子が、創造主が、主が、天と地とその中にある万物の所有者が、さらには万民の裁き主として、あなたがたが管理人を解雇されるときに「どういう管理をしてきたのか説明」しなければならないお方が――「私があなたがたに言う」。不正な管理人からこの点で学び、時にかなった賢い予防策を講じて「不義の富（金銭）で友達を作りなさい」。
It is termed "the mammon of unrighteousness," because of the unrighteous manner wherein it frequently procured, and wherein even that which was honestly procured is generally employed. "Make yourselves friends" of this, by doing all possible good, particularly to the children of God; "that, when ye fail," -- when ye return to dust, when ye have no more place under the sun, -- those of them who are gone before "may receive you," may welcome you, into the "everlasting habitations."
「不義の富」という言葉は、富を手に入れる方法が不正であることが多いためそう言われています。普通は清廉な方法で手に入れた富を使いますが。富を使って「友達を作りなさい」とは、可能なかぎり良いことを、特に神の子供たちに行いなさいということです。「あなたがたが落ちぶれたとき」、つまりあなたがたが日の下にもう生きる場所をなくしたたときに、先に逝った者たちがあなたを歓迎し、「永遠の住まいに迎えてくれます」。

2 An excellent branch of Christian wisdom is here inculcated by our Lord on all his followers, namely, the right use of money -- a subject largely spoken of, after their manner, by men of the world; but not sufficiently considered by those whom God hath chosen out of the world.
（二）　私たちの主がここで弟子たちに説かれたのは、クリスチャンの知恵の中でも特にすぐれた分野です。それは富の使い方です。富の使い方というテーマは、世の人々の間ではなじみ深く誰しも一家言ありますが、神が世から連れ出した人々の間では十分に考えられてきませんでした。
These, generally, do not consider, as the importance of the subject requires, the use of this excellent talent. Neither do they understand how to employ it to the greatest advantage; the introduction of which into the world is one admirable instance of the wise and gracious providence of God.
このテーマの重要性は熟慮を要するものですが、にもかかわらず一般的にクリスチャンは深く考えてきませんでした。また金銭を最大限に有効活用するためにはどうすれば良いか理解していませんでした。金銭の活用法を世に紹介すれば、知恵と恵みに満ちた神のご配慮を知ってもらう良い機会になるでしょう。
It has, indeed, been the manner of poets, orators, and philosophers, in almost all ages and nations, to rail at this, as the grand corrupter of the world, the bane of virtue, the pest of human society. Hence nothing so commonly heard, as:
じっさい金銭の悪口となれば、時代や国を問わず、詩人や雄弁家や哲学者が口々に語ってきました。いわく、金銭は世の堕落をまねく張本人である、悪徳である、人間社会のペストである、と。そのため次のような格言ほどありふれたものはありません。

Nocens ferrum, ferroque nocentius aurum: And gold, more mischievous than keenest steel.
\Nocens ferrum, ferroque nocentius aurum（金はどんなに鋭い剣よりも人を傷つける）

Hence the lamentable complaint,
ため息まじりにこう言われたりします。

Effodiuntur opes, irritamenta malorum. [Wealth is dug up, incentive to all ill.]
\Effodiuntur opes, irritamenta malorum. （富が掘り起こされるとすべての人が病む）

Nay, one celebrated writer gravely exhorts his countrymen, in order to banish all vice at once, to " throw all their money into the sea:"
それだけでなく、ある有名な著作家が重々しく同胞にこう忠告しています。すべての悪を一度に放逐するためには「金銭を残らず海に投げ捨てなさい」と。

. . . in mare proximum [. . .]  Summi materiem mali!
\in mare proximum [. . .]  Summi materiem mali!

But is not all this mere empty rant Is there any solid reason therein By no means. For, let the world be as corrupt as it will, is gold or silver to blame "The love of money," we know, "is the root of all evil;" but not the thing itself.
けれども、こうした怒りの声はじつは空疎なものではないでしょうか。確かな根拠が何かあるのでしょうか。いいえ、事実無根です。と申しますのも、世は何もしなくても堕落していくものだからです。金や銀に責任があるでしょうか。「金銭を愛することがすべての悪の根である」と私たちは知っていますが、しかし金銭自体が悪なのではありません。
The fault does not lie in the money, but in them that use it. It may be used ill: and what may not But it may likewise be used well: It is full as applicable to the best, as to the worst uses. It is of unspeakable service to all civilized nations, in all the common affairs of life:
金銭に非があるのではなく、問題は使い方です。悪い使い方がありえるように、良い使い方もありえます。最悪の目的のためにも使えますし、最良の目的のためにも使えます。金銭は、文明の発達したすべての国にとって、生活の問題と密接に関わっていて、その場面は数え切れないほどさまざまです。
It is a most compendious instrument of transacting all manner of business, and (if we use it according to Christian wisdom) of doing all manner of good. It is true, were man in a state of innocence, or were all men "filled with the Holy Ghost," so that, like the infant Church at Jerusalem, "no man counted anything he had his own," but "distribution was made to everyone as he had need," the use of it would be superseded; as we cannot conceive there is anything of the kind among the inhabitants of heaven.
どんな仕事をするにしても、金銭はそれを遂行する最も簡便な道具ですから、クリスチャンの知恵によって用いるならという条件付きですが、良い行いをするための道具にもなります。真実を申し上げますが、もし人の罪がなくなるなら、あるいはすべての人が「聖霊に満たされる」なら、初期のエルサレム教会と同じように金銭の使い方が百八十度変わるでしょう。初期の教会では「誰も自分の持ち物とみなさなかった」が「配分は全員に必要なぶんだけあった」と伝えられています。私たちには想像も及びませんが、天の住民にもそういう習慣があるのでしょう。
But, in the present state of mankind, it is an excellent gift of God, answering the noblest ends. In the hands of his children, it is food for the hungry, drink for the thirsty, raiment for the naked: It gives to the traveller and the stranger where to lay his head. By it we may supply the place of an husband to the widow, and of a father to the fatherless. We maybe a defence for the oppressed, a means of health to the sick, of ease to them that are in pain; it may be as eyes to the blind, as feet to the lame; yea, a lifter up from the gates of death!
けれども、現在の人類にあっては、金銭を崇高な目的のために使うことは、神の素晴らしい賜物です。神の子たちの手にある金銭は、飢える者にとって食物であり、渇く者にとって飲み物であり、裸の者にとって衣服です。旅行者と放浪者にとって横になって休める寝床です。金銭があれば、やもめには夫を、孤児には父を提供できます。虐げられている者には守りを、病気の者には治療を、痛みにある者には安心を提供できます。目の見えない者には目を、足のなえた者には足を。そうです、人々を死の門から引き上げることができます。

3 It is therefore of the highest concern that all who fear God know how to employ this valuable talent; that they be instructed how it may answer these glorious ends, and in the highest degree. And, perhaps, all the instructions which are necessary for this may be reduced to three plain rules, by the exact observance whereof we may approve ourselves faithful stewards of "the mammon of unrighteousness."
（三）　そのため、最大の関心事は、神を恐れるすべての人が、この価値ある賜物の使い方を知り、このような栄光の目的のために使うにはどうしたらよいかを学ぶことです。そして、そのために必要なものは三つの平易なルールに要約できます。それを厳密に守ることによって私たちは「不義の富」を管理する忠実な管理人となることができます。

## 第一部

I. 1. The first of these is (he that heareth, let him understand!) "Gain all you can." Here we may speak like the children of the world: We meet them on their own ground. And it is our bounden duty to do this: We ought to gain all we can gain, without buying gold too dear, without paying more for it than it is worth. But this it is certain we ought not to do; we ought not to gain money at the expense of life, nor (which is in effect the same thing) at the expense of our health. Therefore, no gain whatsoever should induce us to enter into, or to continue in, any employ, which is of such a kind, or is attended with so hard or so long labour, as to impair our constitution. Neither should we begin or continue in any business which necessarily deprives us of proper seasons for food and sleep, in such a proportion as our nature requires. Indeed, there is a great difference here.
（一）　第一に、（聞く耳のある方は理解してください！）「大いに獲得しなさい」。世の子らのような言い方に聞こえるかもしれませんが、まず世の子らと同じ土俵に立ちます。金を買うのに必要以上に払わず、価値以上の値段を支払わずに、大いに獲得することが私たちの義務です。けれども、いのちを削ってまで、また（同じことですが）健康を損なってまでして、金銭を獲得しようとしてはなりません。ですから、金銭を獲得するためといっても、長時間一生懸命に働き過ぎて体を壊してしまうような働き方は、単発の仕事でも継続的な仕事でもとにかく避けるべきです。またどんな仕事をするにしても、食事と睡眠は自然の要求するとおり一定量必要なのですから、それを適宜取れないような仕事は、始めるべきではありませんし続けるべきでもありません。じっさい、ここに大きな違いがあります。
Some employments are absolutely and totally unhealthy; as those which imply the dealing much with arsenic, or other equally hurtful minerals, or the breathing an air tainted with steams of melting lead, which must at length destroy the firmest constitution. Others may not be absolutely unhealthy, but only to persons of a weak constitution. Such are those which require many hours to be spent in writing; especially if a person write sitting, and lean upon his stomach, or remain long in an uneasy posture.
誰が行っても必ず健康に害なす仕事というものはあります。ヒ素などの有毒な物質を多量に取り扱う仕事や、溶けた鉛のガスで汚染された空気を吸いこんでしまうような仕事は、どんなに頑丈な体でも損ないます。あるいは、誰でもというほどでなくても、体の弱い人にとって健康に害なす仕事もあります。たとえば長時間書き続けなければいけない仕事、特に座りっぱなしで背中を折り曲げ、無理な姿勢をずっと維持しなければならない場合などは、体の弱い人にはつらいでしょう。
But whatever it is which reason or experience shows to be destructive of health or strength, that we may not submit to; seeing "the life is more" valuable "than meat, and the body than raiment." And if we are already engaged in such an employ, we should exchange it as soon as possible for some which, if it lessen our gain, will, however not lessen our health.
健康を損なうことが理性や経験から判断できるような仕事には従事してはなりません。「いのちは肉にまさり、体は衣服にまさる」とあるとおり、いのちは肉よりも価値があるのですから。もうすでにそういう仕事についているなら、できるだけ早く転職するべきです。たとえ収入が少なくなっても、健康を損なわない仕事を探すべきです。

2 We are, Secondly, to gain all we can without hurting our mind any more than our body. For neither may we hurt this. We must preserve, at all events, the spirit of an healthful mind. Therefore we may not engage or continue in any sinful trade, any that is contrary to the law of God, or of our country. Such are all that necessarily imply our robbing or defrauding the king of his lawful customs. For it is at least as sinful to defraud the king of his right, as to rob our fellow subjects. And the king has full as much right, to his customs as we have to our houses and apparel.
（二）　第二に、大いに獲得するといっても、肉体だけでなく精神も損なわないようにしなさい。どちらも傷つけてはなりません。何をするにしても、健康な心の霊を保たなければなりません。ですから、罪となるような商売、神の律法や国の法律に反するような商売は、始めるべきではありませんし続けるべきでもありません。たとえば王から関税を奪い取ったりだまし取ったりするような仕事です。それは少なくとも、王の正当な権利を騙し取っているという点で、人の物を盗むのと同じ罪です。私たちが家や衣服を所有する権利があるのと同じように、王には税関を所有する正当な権利があるのですから。
Other businesses there are, which however innocent in themselves, cannot be followed with innocence now at least, not in England; such, for instance, as will not afford a competent maintenance without cheating or lying, or conformity to some custom which not consistent with a good conscience: These, likewise, are sacredly to be avoided, whatever gain they may be attended with provided we follow the custom of the trade; for to gain money we must not lose our souls.
また他にも、それ自体は悪くなくても、本国の外？？で少なくとも無実でいられないようあｎ仕事もあります。たとえば、嘘やごまかしなしではきちんと維持できないような事業や、良心に反する習慣にならった事業といったものです。商習慣に従って行うとしても、そういう仕事で金銭を獲得するのは、宗教的観点からすると避けるべきです。金銭を得るために魂を損したら本末転倒です。
There are yet others which many pursue with perfect innocence, without hurting either their body or mind; And yet perhaps you cannot: Either they may entangle you in that company which would destroy your soul; and by repeated experiments it may appear that you cannot separate the one from the other; or there may be an idiosyncrasy, -- a peculiarity in your constitution of soul, (as there is in the bodily constitution of many,) by reason whereof that employment is deadly to you, which another may safely follow.
あるいは他にも、多くの人がまったく罪を犯さずに行うことができ、体や心を傷つけるわけではないものの、人によっては避けるべき仕事もあります。少し間違うと魂を損なう可能性のある仕事に従事したとき、繰り返し何度も試すうちに、あなたが個人的に罪とそうでない部分を上手に切り分けられないとわかってくるかもしれません。つまり、肉体の個人差があるのと同じように魂にも個人差があって、他の人には何でもないとしてもあなたにとってはその仕事に何か魂に害毒となるものがあるかもしれません。
So I am convinced, from many experiments, I could not study, to any degree of perfection, either mathematics, arithmetic, or algebra, without being a Deist, if not an Atheist: And yet others may study them all their lives without sustaining any inconvenience. None therefore can here determine for another; but every man must judge for himself, and abstain from whatever he in particular finds to be hurtful to his soul.
私の場合、これは多くの試行結果から確信しているのですが、数学、算術、代数などをある程度習得しようとすれば、無神論者とまではいかないまでも理神論者にならずにいられません。他の方々は数学を学ぶときにそういう不自由を忍ぶ必要はないかもしれません。ですから、誰も他人を決めつけることはできませんが、おのおのが自分自身を裁いて、個人的に魂に害なすとわかったものは差し控えなければなりません。

3 We are. Thirdly, to gain all we can without hurting our neighbour. But this we may not, cannot do, if we love our neighbour as ourselves. We cannot, if we love everyone as ourselves, hurt anyone in his substance. We cannot devour the increase of his lands, and perhaps the lands and houses themselves, by gaming, by overgrown bills (whether on account of physic, or law, or anything else,) or by requiring or taking such interest as even the laws of our country forbid.
（三）　第三に、大いに獲得するといっても、隣人を傷つけないようにしなさい。とはいえ、自分自身のように隣人を愛するなら、このようなことは起こりえないのですが。人を自分自身のように愛するなら、誰かの財産を損なうようなことはしません。他人の土地が増えるのをうらやんだり、他人が土地や家を持っていること自体をうらやんで、それを奪い取ろうと画策し、賭け事をしたり、請求書を乱発したり、違法な利息を取ったりするといったことはありえません。
Hereby all pawn-broking is excluded: Seeing, whatever good we might do thereby, all unprejudiced men see with grief to be abundantly overbalanced by the evil. And if it were otherwise, yet we are not allowed to "do evil that good may come." We cannot, consistent with brotherly love, sell our goods below the market price; we cannot study to ruin our neighbour's trade, in order to advance our own; much less can we entice away or receive any of his servants or workmen whom he has need of. None can gain by swallowing up his neighbour's substance, without gaining the damnation of hell!
そのため、質屋業はやめるべきです。どんなに良いことをしているつもりでも、公平な人が見れば悪によって大きく逸脱していることはお見通しです。たとえそうでなくとも、私たちは「善を来たらせるために悪を行う」ことを許されていません。また私たちは兄弟愛の思想に立つなら、物を市場価格より不当に低く売ることはできません。自分が市場で優位に立つために隣人の商売を邪魔するようなことを企んだりしません。隣人の使用人や雇い人を引き抜いたり何かを受け取ろうとしたりしません。誰でも金銭を獲得するために隣人の財産を飲み込むなら、地獄の罰をも獲得することになります！

4 Neither may we gain by hurting our neighbour in his body. Therefore we may not sell anything which tends to impair health. Such is, eminently, all that liquid fire, commonly called drams or spirituous liquors. It is true, these may have a place in medicine; they may be of use in some bodily disorders; although there would rarely be occasion for them were it not for the unskillfulness of the practitioner. Therefore, such as prepare and sell them only for this end may keep their conscience clear. But who are they Who prepare and sell them only for this end Do you know ten such distillers in England Then excuse these. But all who sell them in the common way, to any that will buy, are poisoners general. They murder His Majesty's subjects by wholesale, neither does their eye pity or spare. They drive them to hell like sheep. And what is their gain Is it not the blood of these men Who then would envy their large estates and sumptuous palaces A curse is in the midst of them: The curse of God cleaves to the stones, the timber, the furniture of them. The curse of God is in their gardens, their walks, their groves; a fire that burns to the nethermost hell! Blood, blood is there: The foundation, the floor, the walls, the roof are stained with blood! And canst thou hope, O thou man of blood, though thou art "clothed in scarlet and fine linen, and farest sumptuously every day;" canst thou hope to deliver down thy fields of blood to the third generation Not so; for there is a God in heaven: Therefore, thy name shall soon be rooted out. Like as those whom thou hast destroyed, body and soul, "thy memorial shall perish with thee!"

5 And are not they partakers of the same guilt, though in a lower degree, whether Surgeons, Apothecaries, or Physicians, who play with the lives or health of men, to enlarge their own gain Who purposely lengthen the pain or disease which they are able to remove speedily who protract the cure of their patient's body in order to plunder his substance Can any man be clear before God who does not shorten every disorder "as much as he can," and remove all sickness and pain "as soon as he can" He cannot: For nothing can be more clear than that he does not "love his neighbour as himself;" than that he does not "do unto others as he would they should do unto himself."

6 This is dear-bought gain. And so is whatever is procured by hurting our neighbour in his soul; by ministering, suppose, either directly or indirectly, to his unchastity, or intemperance, which certainly none can do, who has any fear of God, or any real desire of pleasing Him. It nearly concerns all those to consider this, who have anything to do with taverns, victualling-houses, opera-houses, play-houses, or any other places of public, fashionable diversion. If these profit the souls of men, you are clear; your employment is good, and your gain innocent; but if they are either sinful in themselves, or natural inlets to sin of various kinds, then, it is to be feared, you have a sad account to make. O beware, lest God say in that day, "These have perished in their iniquity, but their blood do I require at thy hands!"

7 These cautions and restrictions being observed, it is the bounden duty of all who are engaged in worldly business to observe that first and great rule of Christian wisdom with respect to money, "Gain all you can." Gain all you can by honest industry. Use all possible diligence in your calling. Lose no time. If you understand yourself and your relation to God and man, you know you have none to spare. If you understand your particular calling as you ought, you will have no time that hangs upon your hands. Every business will afford some employment sufficient for every day and every hour. That wherein you are placed, if you follow it in earnest, will leave you no leisure for silly, unprofitable diversions. You have always something better to do, something that will profit you, more or less. And "whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might." Do it as soon as possible: No delay! No putting off from day to day, or from hour to hour! Never leave anything till to-morrow, which you can do to-day. And do it as well as possible. Do not sleep or yawn over it: Put your whole strength to the work. Spare no pains. Let nothing be done by halves, or in a slight and careless manner. Let nothing in your business be left undone if it can be done by labour or patience.

8 Gain all you can, by common sense, by using in your business all the understanding which God has given you. It is amazing to observe, how few do this; how men run on in the same dull track with their forefathers. But whatever they do who know not God, this is no rule for you. It is a shame for a Christian not to improve upon them, in whatever he takes in hand. You should be continually learning, from the experience of others, or from your own experience, reading, and reflection, to do everything you have to do better to-day than you did yesterday. And see that you practise whatever you learn, that you may make the best of all that is in your hands.

II. 1. Having gained all you can, by honest wisdom and unwearied diligence, the second rule of Christian prudence is," Save all you can." Do not throw the precious talent into the sea: Leave that folly to heathen philosophers. Do not throw it away in idle expenses, which is just the same as throwing it into the sea. Expend no part of it merely to gratify the desire of the flesh, the desire of the eye, or the pride of life.

2 Do not waste any part of so precious a talent merely in gratifying the desires of the flesh; in procuring the pleasures of sense of whatever kind; particularly, in enlarging the pleasure of tasting. I do not mean, avoid gluttony and drunkenness only: An honest heathen would condemn these. But there is a regular, reputable kind of sensuality, an elegant epicurism, which does not immediately disorder the stomach, nor (sensibly, at least) impair the understanding. And yet (to mention no other effects of it now) it cannot be maintained without considerable expense. Cut off all this expense! Despise delicacy and variety, and be content with what plain nature requires.

3 Do not waste any part of so precious a talent merely in gratifying the desire of the eye by superfluous or expensive apparel, or by needless ornaments. Waste no part of it in curiously adorning your houses; in superfluous or expensive furniture; in costly pictures, painting, gilding, books; in elegant rather than useful gardens. Let your neighbours, who know nothing better, do this: "Let the dead bury their dead." But "what is that to thee" says our Lord: "Follow thou me." Are you willing Then you are able so to do.

4 Lay out nothing to gratify the pride of life, to gain the admiration or praise of men. This motive of expense is frequently interwoven with one or both of the former. Men are expensive in diet, or apparel, or furniture, not barely to please their appetite, or to gratify their eye, their imagination, but their vanity too. "So long as thou dost well unto thyself, men will speak good of thee." So long as thou art "clothed in purple and fine linen, and farest sumptuously" every day," no doubt many will applaud thy elegance of taste, thy generosity and hospitality. But do not buy their applause so dear. Rather be content with the honour that cometh from God.

5 Who would expend anything in gratifying these desires if he considered that to gratify them is to increase them Nothing can be more certain than this: Daily experience shows, the more they are indulged, they increase the more. Whenever, therefore, you expend anything to please your taste or other senses, you pay so much for sensuality. When you lay out money to please your eye, you give so much for an increase of curiosity, -- for a stronger attachment to these pleasures which perish in the using. While you are purchasing anything which men use to applaud, you are purchasing more vanity. Had you not then enough of vanity, sensuality, curiosity before Was there need of any addition And would you pay for it, too What manner of wisdom is this Would not the literally throwing your money into the sea be a less mischievous folly

6 And why should you throw away money upon your children, any more than upon yourself, in delicate food, in gay or costly apparel, in superfluities of any kind Why should you purchase for them more pride or lust, more vanity, or foolish and hurtful desires They do not want any more; they have enough already; nature has made ample provision for them: Why should you be at farther expense to increase their temptations and snares, and to pierce them through with more sorrows

7 Do not leave it to them to throw away. If you have good reason to believe that they would waste what is now in your possession in gratifying and thereby increasing the desire of the flesh, the desire of the eye, or the pride of life at the peril of theirs and your own soul, do not set these traps in their way. Do not offer your sons or your daughters unto Belial, any more than unto Moloch. Have pity upon them, and remove out of their way what you may easily foresee would increase their sins, and consequently plunge them deeper into everlasting perdition! How amazing then is the infatuation of those parents who think they can never leave their children enough! What! cannot you leave them enough of arrows, firebrands, and death Not enough of foolish and hurtful desires Not enough of pride, lust, ambition vanity not enough of everlasting burnings Poor wretch! thou fearest where no fear is. Surely both thou and they, when ye are lifting up your eyes in hell, will have enough both of the "worm that never dieth," and of "the fire that never shall be quenched!"

8 "What then would you do, if you was in my case If you had a considerable fortune to leave" Whether I would do it or no, I know what I ought to do: This will admit of no reasonable question. If I had one child, elder or younger, who knew the value of money; one who I believed, would put it to the true use, I should think it my absolute, indispensable duty to leave that child the bulk of my fortune; and to the rest just so much as would enable them to live in the manner they had been accustomed to do. "But what, if all your children were equally ignorant of the true use of money" I ought then (hard saying! who can hear it) to give each what would keep him above want, and to bestow all the rest in such a manner as I judged would be most for the glory of God.

III. 1. But let not any man imagine that he has done anything, barely by going thus far, by "gaining and saving all he can," if he were to stop here. All this is nothing, if a man go not forward, if he does not point all this at a farther end. Nor, indeed, can a man properly be said to save anything, if he only lays it up. You may as well throw your money into the sea, as bury it in the earth. And you may as well bury it in the earth, as in your chest, or in the Bank of England. Not to use, is effectually to throw it away. If, therefore, you would indeed "make yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness," add the Third rule to the two preceding. Having, First, gained all you can, and, Secondly saved all you can, Then "give all you can."

2 In order to see the ground and reason of this, consider, when the Possessor of heaven and earth brought you into being, and placed you in this world, he placed you here not as a proprietor, but a steward: As such he entrusted you, for a season, with goods of various kinds; but the sole property of these still rests in him, nor can be alienated from him. As you yourself are not your own, but his, such is, likewise, all that you enjoy. Such is your soul and your body, not your own, but God's. And so is your substance in particular. And he has told you, in the most clear and express terms, how you are to employ it for him, in such a manner, that it may be all an holy sacrifice, acceptable through Christ Jesus. And this light, easy service, he has promised to reward with an eternal weight of glory.

3 The directions which God has given us, touching the use of our worldly substance, may be comprised in the following particulars. If you desire to be a faithful and a wise steward, out of that portion of your Lord's goods which he has for the present lodged in your hands, but with the right of resuming whenever it pleases him, First, provide things needful for yourself; food to eat, raiment to put on, whatever nature moderately requires for preserving the body in health and strength. Secondly, provide these for your wife, your children, your servants, or any others who pertain to your household. If when this is done there be an overplus left, then "do good to them that are of the household of faith." If there be an overplus still, "as you have opportunity, do good unto all men." In so doing, you give all you can; nay, in a sound sense, all you have: For all that is laid out in this manner is really given to God. You "render unto God the things that are God's," not only by what you give to the poor, but also by that which you expend in providing things needful for yourself and your household.

4 If, then, a doubt should at any time arise in your mind concerning what you are going to expend, either on yourself or any part of your family, you have an easy way to remove it. Calmly and seriously inquire, "(1.) In expending this, am I acting according to my character Am I acting herein, not as a proprietor, but as a steward of my Lord's goods (2.) Am I doing this in obedience to his Word In what Scripture does he require me so to do (3.) Can I offer up this action, this expense, as a sacrifice to God through Jesus Christ (4.) Have I reason to believe that for this very work I shall have a reward at the resurrection of the just" You will seldom need anything more to remove any doubt which arises on this head; but by this four-fold consideration you will receive clear light as to the way wherein you should go.

5 If any doubt still remain, you may farther examine yourself by prayer according to those heads of inquiry. Try whether you can say to the Searcher of hearts, your conscience not condemning you, "Lord, thou seest I am going to expend this sum on that food, apparel, furniture. And thou knowest, I act herein with a single eye as a steward of thy goods, expending this portion of them thus in pursuance of the design thou hadst in entrusting me with them. Thou knowest I do this in obedience to the Lord, as thou commandest, and because thou commandest it. Let this, I beseech thee, be an holy sacrifice, acceptable through Jesus Christ! And give me a witness in myself that for this labour of love I shall have a recompense when thou rewardest every man according to his works." Now if your conscience bear you witness in the Holy Ghost that this prayer is well-pleasing to God, then have you no reason to doubt but that expense is right and good, and such as will never make you ashamed.

6 You see then what it is to "make yourselves friends of the mammon of unrighteousness," and by what means you may procure, "that when ye fail they may receive you into the everlasting habitations." You see the nature and extent of truly Christian prudence so far as it relates to the use of that great talent, money. Gain all you can, without hurting either yourself or your neighbour, in soul or body, by applying hereto with unintermitted diligence, and with all the understanding which God has given you; -- save all you can, by cutting off every expense which serves only to indulge foolish desire; to gratify either the desire of flesh, the desire of the eye, or the pride of life; waste nothing, living or dying, on sin or folly, whether for yourself or your children; -- and then, give all you can, or, in other words, give all you have to God. Do not stint yourself, like a Jew rather than a Christian, to this or that proportion. "Render unto God," not a tenth, not a third, not half, but all that is God's, be it more or less; by employing all on yourself, your household, the household of faith, and all mankind, in such a manner, that you may give a good account of your stewardship when ye can be no longer stewards; in such a manner as the oracles of God direct, both by general and particular precepts; in such a manner, that whatever ye do may be "a sacrifice of a sweet-smelling savour to God," and that every act may be rewarded in that day when the Lord cometh with all his saints.

7 Brethren, can we be either wise or faithful stewards unless we thus manage our Lord's goods We cannot, as not only the oracles of God, but our own conscience beareth witness. Then why should we delay Why should we confer any longer with flesh and blood, or men of the world Our kingdom, our wisdom is not of this world: Heathen custom is nothing to us. We follow no men any farther than they are followers of Christ. Hear ye him. Yea, to-day, while it is called to-day, hear and obey his voice! At this hour, and from this hour, do his will: Fulfil his word, in this and in all things! I entreat you, in the name of the Lord Jesus, act up to the dignity of your calling! No more sloth! Whatsoever your hand findeth to do, do it with your might! No more waste! Cut off every expense which fashion, caprice, or flesh and blood demand! No more covetousness! But employ whatever God has entrusted you with, in doing good, all possible good, in every possible kind and degree to the household of faith, to all men! This is no small part of "the wisdom of the just." Give all ye have, as well as all ye are, a spiritual sacrifice to Him who withheld not from you his Son, his only Son: So "laying up in store for yourselves a good foundation against the time to come, that ye may attain eternal life!"
